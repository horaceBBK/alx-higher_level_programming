# 0x00 Python - Hello, World

This project comprises several tasks in Python scripting. Each task has specific requirements and objectives.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Run Python Script Using Shell Script

Write a Shell script that executes a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.

### 1. Run Python Code Using Shell Script

Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE.

### 2. Print a Specific String in Python

Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a new line, using the function print.

### 3. Print Integer and String Concatenation

Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by "Battery street", followed by a new line. The code must be 3 lines long and use f-strings.

### 4. Print Float with Precision

Complete the source code to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits. You must use f-strings.

### 5. Print Strings and Slices

Complete this source code to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters. You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement. Your program should be maximum 5 lines long.

### 6. Print Using Variables Only

Complete this source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!" using only the variables str1 and str2. Your program should be exactly 5 lines long, and you cannot use any loops or conditional statements.

### 7. Manipulate Strings and Print

Complete this source code to manipulate strings and print specific substrings. You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements. Your program should be exactly 8 lines long.

### 8. Print Using Specific Variables Only

Complete this source code to print "object-oriented programming with Python", followed by a new line. You are not allowed to create new variables or use string literals. Your program should be exactly 5 lines long.

### 9. Print "The Zen of Python"

Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. The script should be a maximum of 98 characters long.

### 10. Check for Cycle in Singly Linked List (C)

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it. You are restricted to using specific functions and are not allowed to use any other functions.

### 11. Print to Stderr in Python

Write a Python script that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19", followed by a new line. The script should print to stderr and exit with status code 1.

### 12. Compile Python Script

Write a script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE, and the output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc).

### 13. Recreate Python Bytecode

Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b) that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode.

Each task is unique and aims to reinforce various aspects of Python scripting and programming concepts.
