# 0x02 Python - Import Modules

In this project, I will be undertaking several tasks that focus on understanding module imports and working with Python modules.

## Tasks Overview

Each task is unique and aims to reinforce various aspects of Python scripting and programming concepts.

0. **Import and Print:** Write a program that imports the 'add' function from 'add_0.py' and prints the result of adding 1 + 2.

1. **Import Functions and Perform Math:** Write a program that imports functions from 'calculator_1.py', performs mathematical operations, and prints the results.

2. **Print Number of Arguments:** Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed and lists the arguments along with their positions.

3. **Add All Arguments:** Write a program that prints the result of adding all arguments passed as command-line arguments.

4. **Print Names from Compiled Module:** Write a program that prints all names defined by the compiled module 'hidden_4.pyc' in alphabetical order.

5. **Import Variable and Print Value:** Write a program that imports a variable 'a' from 'variable_load_5.py' and prints its value.

6. **Handle Basic Operations:** Write a program that imports functions from 'calculator_1.py' and performs basic arithmetic operations based on command-line arguments.

7. **Print #pythoniscool:** Write a program that prints '#pythoniscool' in the standard output, limited to maximum 2 lines.

8. **Python Function - Magic Calculation:** Implement a Python function 'magic_calculation(a, b)' that mirrors a given Python bytecode.

9. **Print Alphabet in Uppercase:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase in the standard output, limited to a maximum of 3 lines, without using loops, conditional statements, str.join(), or any system calls.
