# 0x03 Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In this project, I will be tackling various tasks that involve working with lists and tuples in Python. Each task aims to reinforce different aspects of handling data structures in Python.

## Tasks Overview

Each task is designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in manipulating Python lists, tuples, and associated data structure operations.

0. **Print List Integers:** Write a function that prints all integers of a list in a specific format.

1. **Retrieve Element from List:** Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

2. **Replace Element in List:** Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

3. **Print Reversed List Integers:** Write a function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

4. **New Element in List without Modification:** Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

5. **Remove Characters from String:** Write a function that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.

6. **Print Matrix of Integers:** Write a function that prints a matrix of integers in a specific format.

7. **Add 2 Tuples:** Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

8. **Return Length and First Character of String:** Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9. **Find Biggest Integer in List:** Write a function that finds the biggest integer in a list.

10. **Find Multiples of 2 in List:** Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

11. **Delete Item at Specific Position in List:** Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

12. **Switch Values of a and b:** Complete the source code to switch the value of 'a' and 'b' in a specific way.

13. **Check Palindrome in Singly Linked List (C):** Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

14. **Understand Python Lists in CPython:** Create a C function that prints basic info about Python lists.

15. **Exploring Python and C Interaction:** Discusses the CPython reference implementation and explores how Python and C interact.

All tasks are focused on Python data structures, list operations, and their manipulation. Each task reinforces different aspects of Python scripting and programming concepts.
